dp-identity-api
==============

### Getting started

#### MongoDB
* Run ```brew install mongodb```
* Run ```brew services start mongodb```

#### kafka
* Run ```brew install kafka```
* Run ```brew services start zookeeper```
* Run ```brew services start kafka```

### Usage

`make debug` to run locally

### API Tests
To run the **dp-api-tests** against the **dp-identity-api** run `make acceptance`. This will run the API against a 
different (test) Mongo database which will be torn down after the tests. 

### DEV NOTES

1.) Have added basic endpoint for CreateIdentity, `/identities'` with a very basic model.
