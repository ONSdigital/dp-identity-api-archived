DP Identity API
==============

### Getting started

#### MongoDB
* Run ```brew install mongodb```
* Run ```brew services start mongodb```

#### kafka
* Run ```brew install kafka```
* Run ```brew services start zookeeper```
* Run ```brew services start kafka```

### Usage

`make debug` to run locally.

### DEV NOTES

1.) Have added basic endpoints for GetIdentityByID and PostIdentity `('identities/{id}' and '/identities'` respectively), this was just to sanity check the database and auditing
functionality was working as intended. Delete/modify/purge as needed.

2.) The auditor will trigger an error on GetIdentityByID for any requests that lack the correct context fields. This is expected behaviour and not a bug.
